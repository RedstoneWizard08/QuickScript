QuickScript is a language that I am creating to learn how to, well, create a language.
The syntax is very similar to Rust, and it is a semicolon-based language, or at least it will be (I think). The compiler is written in Rust, and uses Cranelift as a backend, with AOT and JIT modes supported, and allows any `libc` function to be called in code. The standard library is pretty nonexistent right now, but it'll get better in the future.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to use the code for whatever you want.

## Installation

Installing QuickScript is incredibly easy!
Here's how you can do it:

**With Cargo:**

```sh
cargo install quickscript
```

**Via GitHub Releases:**

1. Head to https://github.com/RedstoneWizard08/QuickScript/releases
2. Download the correct binary for your platform
3. Run `chmod +x [path to binary here]`
4. Run the binary!

## Usage

For usage details, run `qsc --help`

## Support

Currently, here is the support matrix:

| Version | i686 | x86_64 | armv7l | armhf | arm64 |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
|  0.0.0  | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |
|  0.1.0  | 游댮 | 游리 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |
|  0.3.0  | 游릭 | 游릭 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |
|  0.4.0  | 游릭 | 游릭 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |
|  0.5.x  | 游릭 | 游릭 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |
|  0.6.x  | 游릭 | 游릭 | 游댮 | 游댮 | 游릭 |

Note that armv7l and armhf support is dependent on Cranelift's support for it.
See [cranelift#1173](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1173)
for more details.

Musl builds for i686 are also not supported due to a bug in cargo zigbuild.
See [cargo-zigbuild#96](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild/issues/96)
for more details.

# Credits

Huge thanks to [Pixeled (@orosmatthew)](https://github.com/orosmatthew) and his
[Creating a Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs)
series, as it helped me think about how to do this best and it gave me the
inspiration for this project.

Another huge thanks for the [cranelift-jit-demo](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift-jit-demo),
as it helped me implement the code generator with Cranelift.

# Roadmap

Future plans for QuickScript:

- Add `if` statements, `while` and `for` loops, function definitions as variables, constant (or static) variables, and more.
- Create a language server and syntax for VS Code.
- Port the (mold)[https://github.com/rui314/mold] linker to Rust and use it internally (programmatically) instead of using an external command call.
