This is a modified version of Cranelift's JIT backend, taken from [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/bd2ea901d3fa4555ffb3b8dc73c45455fe8a4439/cranelift/jit) at commit bd2ea901d3fa4555ffb3b8dc73c45455fe8a4439 under the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE).

This crate provides a JIT library that uses
[Cranelift](https://crates.io/crates/cranelift).

This crate is extremely experimental.

See the [example program] for a brief overview of how to use this.
